# PONG
A clone of the legendary classic :-)
Made using pygame in Python. 

If you wanna play make sure you have python installed on your comp! and make sure you have imported the pygame module!

I have included some "DIGITAL CLOCK" fonts just in case you don't have them installed on your PC. 
I mean it should default to Ariel or something I guess, but 'DIGITAL' looks much better :-)
